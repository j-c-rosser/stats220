# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220.

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in civil engineering, environmental science, and statistics. *(I am doing a BE(hons)(Civil)/BSc(environmental science and statistics) conjoint)*
- I am taking **STATS 220** because:
  1. I enjoy stats
  2. I want to gain more experience aquiring and working with data
  3.  I want more experience using computer technologies (other than excel lol) for stats
- I am interested in learning about data aquisition and management of data, especially ways of using computer technology to do this is this is an area I am not so confident in at this stage.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
